# OTP Email Implementation Guide via Gmail

## Slide 1: Title
### Sending OTP Emails via Gmail
**Implementation Guide for Project**

---

## Slide 2: Overview
### Purpose:
- Send a One-Time Password (OTP) to users for verification
- Ensure security and ease of use
- Integrate seamlessly with your app backend

### Key Components:
- Gmail account with App Password
- Backend code to generate OTP
- Email template
- Verification logic

---

## Slide 3: Gmail Setup
### Steps:
1. Enable 2-Step Verification on your Gmail account
2. Go to Security → App Passwords
3. Generate an App Password for "Mail" (use this in your code)

### Notes:
- No subscription required
- Limits: ~100–150 emails/day for free Gmail
- Keep App Password secure

---

## Slide 4: OTP Generation
### Backend Logic:
- Generate a random numeric OTP (6 digits recommended)
- Optionally, store OTP with a timestamp in your database
- OTP should expire (e.g., 5–10 minutes)

### Example (Python):
```python
import random
otp = random.randint(100000, 999999)
```

---

## Slide 5: Email Composition
### Content:
- Friendly greeting: "Hello [User]"
- OTP: e.g., 123456
- Expiration notice: "Valid for 5 minutes"
- Optional instructions: "Don't share this code"

### Template Example:
```
Hello [Username],

Your OTP is: 123456
Valid for 5 minutes.

Thanks,
[App Name]
```

## Slide 6: Sending Email via Gmail SMTP
### Python Example:
```python
import smtplib
from email.mime.text import MIMEText

message = MIMEText(f"Your OTP: {otp}", "plain")
message["Subject"] = "OTP Verification"
message["From"] = sender_email
message["To"] = receiver_email

with smtplib.SMTP_SSL("smtp.gmail.com", 465) as server:
    server.login(sender_email, app_password)
    server.sendmail(sender_email, receiver_email, message.as_string())
```

### Notes:
- Use SSL/TLS for security
- SMTP host: smtp.gmail.com, port: 465

---

## Slide 7: OTP Verification Flow
1. User requests OTP → backend generates OTP
2. OTP sent via Gmail
3. User enters OTP in app
4. Backend verifies OTP and timestamp
5. Success → allow access / verification

**Tip:** Invalidate OTP after successful verification or expiration

---

## Slide 8: Security & Best Practices
- Never expose Gmail password; use App Passwords
- Limit OTP retries to prevent brute-force attacks
- Store OTP securely (hashed if needed)
- Optionally log email send attempts for monitoring

---

## Slide 9: Scaling Tips
- If app grows → Gmail free limits may be too low
- Use email services like SendGrid, Amazon SES, or Mailgun for higher volume
- Implement queueing for sending emails asynchronously

---

## Slide 10: Summary
- Free Gmail + App Password → easy OTP emails
- Backend handles OTP generation, email sending, verification
- Secure and simple solution for small-to-medium apps
