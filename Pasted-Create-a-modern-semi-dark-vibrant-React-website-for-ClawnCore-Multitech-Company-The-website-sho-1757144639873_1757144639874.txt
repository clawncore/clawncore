Create a modern, semi-dark, vibrant React website for “ClawnCore Multitech Company.”
The website should combine elegance, clarity, and futuristic design. It should use soft dark backgrounds with bright highlights, gradients, and smooth animations without being fully dark or dull. The hero section must feature a split layout where one half displays an animated slideshow of images related to drones, agriculture, AI, cloud computing, cybersecurity, and other tech services, and the other half presents the title, logo, and introductory content in a clear and dynamic way. The website should feel engaging, trustworthy, and forward-looking while being visually appealing and easy to navigate.

✅ Design Guidelines

Typography: Clean, bold fonts with animated gradient effects for headers.

Slideshow:

The left half of the hero section displays a slideshow of high-resolution images (drones flying over farms, AI interfaces, cloud computing graphics, cybersecurity grids, mobile apps, and data analytics visuals).

Images should transition smoothly with fade or slide animations.

The right half of the hero section contains the ClawnCore logo at the top, followed by a dynamic header and introductory text with a CTA button.
